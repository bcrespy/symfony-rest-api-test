# A test project

This is a test project to experiment the creation of a RESTful API using Symfony skeleton as a basis to ease everything.

## Why 

The idea is to learn how an RESTful API works behind the scene. As a front-end developer, I sometimes had to build some small micro-services to interact with a database, but often times I ended writing a functionnal but *whacky* solution which works but is neither scalable neither clean.

Also, as a *modern* front-end developer, most of the communications with back-end services are done via REST APIs, and even though using one is pretty straightforward, I sometimes found myself wondering `how does this shit works under the hood, why does it work that way, and am I using it as it was intended to ?` 

This projects was made to fully understand how to secure client-server communications with **JWT authentification** and expose a REST API which interacts with a simple database. I hope to get some experience in that matter and it will for sure help me when I will need to build a backend for my clients.

## Why public

I will try to keep here a list of resources that I found helpful while doing my research, and list the issues I hav encountered and how I tackled them. Maybe you will find here some solutions to problems you encountered yourself in the same process, maybe not. `Who knows`
